# Exercise 2 - Modelling

## What is the benefit of abstraction in the field of software development?

Abstraction makes it easier to view the bigger picture. Without abstratction it
would be nearly impossible to talk about how to implement features without using
some sort of abstraction.

Abstraction simpifies complexity, improves readability, reusability and
maintainability and enables developers to use good design practices.

## What types of components can we distinguish?

- Functional Components
- Infrastructure Components
- UI Components
- Domain Components
- Data Components
- Microservice Components

## What types of relations can we distinguish?

- **Dependency:** One component depends on another.
- **Association:** General link between components, unidirectional or
  bidirectional.
- **Aggregation:** Whole-part relationship where parts can exist independently.
- **Composition:** Strong whole-part relationship where parts cannot exist
  without the whole.
- **Inheritance:** "Is-a" relationship for code reuse.
- **Realization:** Implements an interface.
- **Containment:** One component contained within another.
- **Uses/Calls:** A component calls methods of another.
- **Messaging:** Components communicate by sending messages.
- **Dependency Injection:** Dependencies are provided externally.
- **Client-Server:** One component requests services from another.
- **Publish-Subscribe:** Event-driven interaction.
- **Hierarchical:** Tree-like relationship between components.
- **Association Class:** Association with its own attributes and behavior.
