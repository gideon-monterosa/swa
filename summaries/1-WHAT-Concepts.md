# Software Architecture: Basic Terms and Concepts

## Lecture Overview
This lecture introduces foundational concepts and terms in software architecture, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing software architecture from other architectural disciplines and understanding its unique contribution to enterprise value chains. The lecture aims to provide an in-depth understanding of architecture as a planning and transformation discipline, covering the basic building blocks and essential terminology.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lecture, you should:
- Understand how architecture contributes to the enterprise value chain.
- Distinguish between the three central architecture disciplines (enterprise, domain, and software architecture) and understand their roles.
- Define crucial components of software architecture and explain their significance.
- Understand and use basic architecture concepts and terms.

## Key Topics Covered
1. **Classical Architecture**
   - Classical architecture is concerned with the design of buildings and other urban structures, traditionally seen as both an art and a science.
   - The process involves planning, design, construction, and evaluation, with an emphasis on using appropriate materials and techniques to address specific conditions and needs.
   - The architectural process includes steps like inception, analysis, design, implementation, and validation, resulting in a systematic approach that yields a cohesive whole.

2. **Enterprise Operating Model**
   - The architecture function operates within the broader enterprise context, implemented organizationally through architecture capabilities.
   - An **operating model** specifies how an organization is designed to deliver value, focusing on the essentials of organizational cooperation.
   - **Operating model canvas**: A template for designing operating models and understanding value delivery chains.

3. **Value Delivery Chain**
   - The value delivery chain, based on Michael Porter's model, describes the activities required to deliver valuable products or services.
   - An architecture function supports the establishment, planning, and operation of enterprise services as part of the value chain, encompassing business applications, technical platforms, and enterprise services.

4. **Architecture Disciplines**
   - The lecture focuses on three key architecture disciplines:
     - **Enterprise Architecture**: Ensures alignment between domain and software architectures and develops methods and policies.
     - **Domain Architecture**: Supports decision-making by providing transparency, maintaining as-is and to-be plans, and developing roadmaps.
     - **Software Architecture**: Responsible for the implementation of systems and ensuring conformity between design and implementation.
   - Differentiating these disciplines involves considering the granularity of systems, planning horizons, and contributions to the value chain.

5. **System and System Architecture**
   - The concept of a **system** is central to understanding architecture, which can include technical systems (e.g., machines) or social systems (e.g., organizations).
   - **Teleological vs. Ontological System Notions**:
     - **Teleological**: Deals with external system behaviors (e.g., functionality and quality attributes).
     - **Ontological**: Focuses on the construction of the system (e.g., structure, composition).
   - **System Architecture** involves understanding how a system's visible properties are realized based on its components.
     - It includes both **static** (structural) and **dynamic** (collaborative) aspects.
   - **Holism and Evolution**: Systems evolve continuously, and architecture must adapt accordingly. Holistic design considers entire systems and their evolution over time.

6. **Architecture View Models**
   - **View models** provide different perspectives that combine to create a comprehensive architecture model, such as visualizing public transport, population density, or general system diagrams.
   - The architecture view helps create a holistic picture of complex systems, essential for effective decision-making and evolution management.

7. **Relevance of Architecture**
   - The relevance of architecture increases with the complexity of systems. Effective architecture can help manage this complexity, especially in large systems and organizations where functionality and agility must balance each other.

8. **Differentiating Components of System Architecture**
   - **System under Design**: Every system consists of multiple components, each playing a specific role.
   - The **system core** includes primary business components, while **execution environments** provide runtime containers.
   - **Back-End Systems** offer data and services exchange, while **front-end systems** include client-side technology like web browsers.

## What Concepts
1. **What is software architecture?**
   - Software architecture is the high-level structure of a software system, encompassing the organization of its components, their relationships, and how they interact to achieve the system's objectives. It focuses on key design decisions that impact system quality, performance, maintainability, and scalability.

2. **What are the key components of architecture?**
   - Key components of architecture include systems, components, interfaces, and connectors. Each component has specific responsibilities, and their interactions are defined to meet the desired functional and non-functional requirements. Architecture also involves considering static (structural) and dynamic (behavioral) aspects of these components.

3. **What are the different disciplines within architecture (e.g., enterprise, domain, software)?**
   - **Enterprise Architecture** ensures alignment between different parts of the organization, integrates various systems, and sets policies and methods.
   - **Domain Architecture** supports decision-making at a specific domain level, ensuring transparency, planning, and maintaining standards.
   - **Software Architecture** focuses on designing and implementing individual software systems, ensuring they meet functional requirements and align with enterprise goals.

4. **What are the basic concepts and terms related to architecture?**
   - Basic concepts include **systems**, **components**, **interfaces**, and **architectural views**. Systems can be technical, social, or sociotechnical, and they are composed of interconnected components. **Architectural views** are different perspectives used to understand and design the architecture comprehensively, such as static structure and dynamic behavior views.
