# Software Architecture: HOW - Methodology Overview

### Lecture Overview

This lecture focuses on the methodologies used in the development of software
architecture, discussing the systematic approaches used to solve architectural
problems. The concept of **Architecture HOW** involves understanding and
applying different development models to create and validate architecture
solutions effectively.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you should:

- Gain an overview of the basic features of modern architecture methodologies.
- Understand that methodologies need to be adapted to the contexts they are used
  in.
- Know the role of architecture mandates in guiding methodologies.
- Understand the central components and attitudes of solution architecture
  methodologies.

### Key Topics Covered

1. **Methodology**

   - **Methodology** provides a structured approach to architecture development,
     detailing the valid state and transitions in a system.
   - A methodology outlines systematic, step-by-step procedures specifying what
     information is needed, generated, and who is responsible for each step.
     This promotes systematicity and repeatability in architecture planning,
     development, and validation.
   - Architecture methodologies often include specific methods to facilitate
     discussions about design appropriateness and are closely linked with **view
     models**, making them practically inseparable.
   - Types of architecture methodologies include:
     - **Solution Architecture Development** (e.g., Unified Process, TOGAF,
       ArchiMate)
     - **Enterprise and Domain Architecture Elaboration** (e.g., TOGAF, Zachman)
     - **Reference Architecture Elaboration** (e.g., architecture pattern or
       roadmap methodologies)
     - **Architecture Assessment Methodology** (e.g., ATAM)

2. **Method Adaptation**

   - Methodologies must be adapted to the specific context in which they are
     applied to ensure their effectiveness. This ensures that they remain
     relevant and useful across different environments and projects.

3. **Method Attitude and Approach**

   - A **solution architecture elaboration method** often involves developing a
     solution, identifying deficits, and resolving them.
   - More advanced methods focus on reducing failure costs, improving
     repeatability, and adopting an **iterative approach** to development.
     Iterative methodologies allow the architecture to evolve and adapt,
     enhancing its effectiveness over time.

4. **Architecture Mandate**

   - An **architecture mandate** helps clarify the scope, objectives,
     deliverables, and expectations for all parties involved in architecture
     activities.
   - Architecture mandates promote clarity by distinguishing between **supposed
     needs** (initial assumptions about what is needed) and **actual needs**
     (the real objectives that should be met). This helps ensure that
     architectural efforts are focused and properly aligned with business
     objectives.
   - Mandates also serve as a **yardstick** to measure progress and determine
     when architecture contributions have been sufficiently delivered.

5. **Solution Architecture Methodology**
   - A **solution architecture methodology** standardizes both the
     **development** and **description** of asset architectures, combining a
     development process with a view model.
   - Solution methodologies are designed to capture the full scope of a problem
     and its solution, avoiding monocausal thinking and focusing on relevant
     dimensions.
   - The methodology takes a **holistic approach** and incorporates an
     **evolutionary nature** to accommodate changing problems and solutions.
   - The process of developing a solution description is incremental, with views
     being revisited and refined repeatedly until a comprehensive architecture
     is established.
   - The key steps in **Solution Architecture Elaboration** include:
     - **Determine Architecture Context**: Understand the enterprise context of
       a given problem and how it influences the envisioned solution.
     - **Determine and Refine Architecture Conditions**: Identify conditions
       that significantly shape the target architecture.
     - **Develop Architecture Alternatives and Select**: Develop multiple
       alternative approaches to solving a problem and select the best fit based
       on specific criteria.
     - **Elaborate Solution Architecture**: Develop a design that addresses
       identified conditions, ensuring traceability across views.
     - **Validate Solution Architecture**: Perform validation at key stages to
       ensure that the architecture meets its intended goals.

### Summary

Architecture HOW focuses on the systematic methodologies used to develop and
validate software architecture. Methodologies provide a structured, repeatable
approach to design, ensuring alignment with business needs while allowing
flexibility for changes. By using architecture mandates, methodologies also
provide clarity and ensure progress is effectively tracked. Solution
architecture methodologies combine development processes and view models,
enabling architects to create holistic, adaptable solutions that evolve with
changing requirements.
